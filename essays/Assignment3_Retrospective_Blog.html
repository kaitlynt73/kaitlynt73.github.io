  <h1>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h1>
<p>For my assignments, I created an e-commerce store that sells photographs. In Assignment 3, I was selling bird pictures, flower pictures, and sky pictures. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h1>
<p>After trying to implement a lot of the requirements, I was struggling to make everything work cohesively. For example, when I got my IR (send the user to the last product page they visited after they leave and return to my website), loading the page for the first time would not work. Instead of taking me to my index page, my IR would disrupt and prevent any page from loading.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h1>
<p>I am most proud of being able to understand how my server was working. Due to the time constraint, I was unable to implement everything I wanted to, but working with Professor Port on the server allowed me to get a deeper understanding of how the server works, and what I should do to get through the problems that I was facing. Of course, foreign concepts were difficult to grasp on my own. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h1>
<p>I am least happy / dis-satisfied with the lack of a working email. While working with Professor Port, I was able to send an email of the invoice to the client whenever they hit purchase, but that code unfortunately prevented me from getting to the invoice.html page when I was testing it on the itm-vm server. Since it was preventing something major, I had to remove the code from my final submission, but if you are interested, here is a <a href="https://github.com/kaitlynt73/ITM352_F23_repo/blob/eb41b10b3647457e09eaecac75acdf499d3cb6f3/Tokunaga_Kaitlyn_Assignment3_FIX/server.js">link</a> to the file that has the code.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h1>
<p>Deploying my assignment was different from assignment #2, because I did not have to give the writing/editing conditions.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h1>
<p>I first consulted the internet, including ChatGPT and regular Google searches. Oftentimes, I would get a brief understanding of what to do, but because the concepts were foreign, it was difficult to implement them on my own. Next, I talked to peers to see how they were solving the issues, and lastly, I would ask the professor because he would be able to look at my code and address the issues that are tailored to what I already had.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h1>
<p>In my opinion, setting up the redirects and using sessions/cookies went well for me. Though it took some time to get used to and I had to get advice from Professor Port in the beginning, I was able to figure things out much more quickly after learning how to do things. I also think the css and creating navbar went well. I think this because I really enjoyed doing those things. Designing my website’s aesthetic was fun. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h1>
<p>Coding on my own was a really big struggle for me, because I would consult internet resources that would advise using more advanced concepts compared to the solution Professor Port showed me. Using ChatGPT from time to time was helpful, but when it came to my IR, it was very difficult to work on it on my own with ChatGPT.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h1>
<p>I learned the basics of how to use cookies and sessions, but I also learned that patience is key. I would often go into a spiral of confusion, especially since there was a very strict time constraint for this assignment. Instead of panicking and looking for a solution, I learned that calming myself down and being patient with myself was important in getting things successfully done.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h1>
<p>Since this assignment was assigned a few days before finals week, my schedule was much more skewed towards studying than the assignments before. If I could go back in time, I would give myself a more structured and organized schedule. Since there was so much to work on for this assignment. More structure and organization would have helped me stay on track and complete the assignment faster. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h1>
<p>a: 35%</p>
<p>b: 25%</p>
<p>c: 40%</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h1>
<p>N/A. I worked alone on this project.</p>
