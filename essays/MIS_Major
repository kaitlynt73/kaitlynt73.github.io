# Prompt: * * Why did you decide to major in MIS or take ITM 352? * *

I am currently planning on majoring in Management Information Systems because a few of my previous professors at the Shidler College of Business recommend it as a second major to go along with Accounting. I also enjoyed my ICS 101 class last semester, but was not confident enough to take more ICS or CS courses. With ITM 352, I hope to improve my programming skills and learn how to work that together with business.
