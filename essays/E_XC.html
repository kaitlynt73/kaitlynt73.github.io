<h1>What I learned from the "Talk Story with Tech Professionals" Event</h1>

<p><br /></p>
<h2><b>Prompt</b>: Share a little bit about what you got from the event.</h2>

<p><br /></p>
<p>At the Talk Story with Tech Professionals event, I got to meet six different professionals within the tech field. I spent about 15 minutes with each professional, asking them questions about their careers. Since I am not familiar with the tech field, I got to learn what the day-to-day basis of these professionals is like: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business, and Cyber Security. Though my interest for all fields grew, what caught my attention was Data Analysts. This career intrigues me because many of the subjects I am learning now relate to the field.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Outside of each professionals' career information, I got to learn about their insights on various topics. Topics include: LinkedIn, Social Media, Interview Questions, Cover Letters, and Resumes. Many professionals had varying opinions on if LinkedIn and other social media platforms should be checked, but a lot of professionals agreed that "people skills" is important. One specific professional gave me and my group insight on cover letters and resumes as this professional conducts interviews. All interactions were helpful to me.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>This event gave me a great opportunity to meet professionals and hear their insight on many different topics. I found this event helpful for considering my future career.</p>
